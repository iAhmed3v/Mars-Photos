MarsPhotos
==================================


MarsPhotos is a demo app that shows actual images of Mar's surface. These images are
real-life photos from Mars captured by NASA's Mars rovers. The data is stored on a Web server
as a REST web service.  This is app will demonstrate the use of [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make REST requests to the web service, [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) to
handle the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, and [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) to load images by URL.

The app also leverages [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel),
[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), and
[Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) with binding 
adapters.
